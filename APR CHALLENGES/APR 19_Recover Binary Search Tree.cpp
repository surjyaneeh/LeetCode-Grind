/* Problem :
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.
 */

 /* Approach :
 In a BST the result of traversing in order should be arranged in increasing order.
 Thus to identify which nodes are in the wrong position we simply check when two consecutive nodes are not arranged in increasing order.
 */

 /* Steps :
1. traverse the tree in order.
2. identify which nodes are in the wrong position.
3. swap the wrong nodes.
 */
